# Suspicious-Browser-Extensions
This task involved auditing browser extensions to identify and remove those that may pose security or privacy risks. By accessing the browser’s extension manager, each installed extension was carefully reviewed based on its permissions, developer credibility, usage status, and user feedback. Suspicious and unused extensions—especially those with excessive permissions or poor reviews—were removed to enhance both browser security and performance.

Through this activity, a deeper understanding of how malicious extensions can operate (such as stealing data, injecting ads, or tracking user activity) was gained. The task highlights the importance of regularly monitoring and managing browser add-ons as part of basic cybersecurity hygiene.
